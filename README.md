# CryptoClustering

## K-Means Clustering
- Elbow method was used to visually identify the best value for k
- Initialized and fit the K-Means model to the data
- Predicted clusters for the data
- Plots the clusters using hvPlot

## PCA
- Used a PCA model to determine how much varience could be described by the principal components
- Created a new dataframe for the PCA data
- The elbow method was again used for this data set
- This data was then clustered with the K-Means algorithm and plotted

## Vizualization
- The elbow and K-Means plots were then shown side by side to see how the dimension reduction effected the data.
